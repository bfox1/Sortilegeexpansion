==================

A magic mod that brings modern tech together to make a new experience of a mod.

Things that need to be setup before any of the mod may continue to work.

We need "Most" machines to be ran from a magical power source. Similar to electric power, A code needs to be written from 
scratch in order to make it. Then we can apply it to all mods that require it in order to do there various functions.

{Generator} - Breaks down ALL Blocks and Items into a Raw liquid essence. Each item and block has its value, these values
must be somehow calculated either withing the power source code OR this generator. All the sides of the Generator can 
output liquid into a container. Generator requires some kind of fuel for operation.

{Decayer} - Main ability; to break down Ores into a very aged substance in order to get lambent essence. Output includes
1 decayed/powdered {ore}, 2 lambent essence, and an aged stone dust.

{Purifier} - Main ability; to purify the decayed/powdered, and the lambent essences. output would be 2 purified essence,
and 2 ingots of the decayed ore. Ex. 1 decayed iron = 2 iron ingots. 

These are the main things right now.
